## Build & Run

1. Clone
2. `$ npm install` or `$ yarn` from root 
3. `$ npm start` or `$ yarn start` from root
4. Navigate to `localhost:3000` on your browser

## Deploy

I have set up an npm script to build and deploy (no CI yet) using one command.

Just run `$ yarn deploy` and the optimized static build will be pushed [here](https://mobicare.surge.sh)
