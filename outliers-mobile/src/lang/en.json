I had experience in developing and branding my own protein bars before opening my clinic. I was confident in my knowledge in nutrition, and I had fun while developing the protein bars because I always wished to do business rather than running a clinic. However, I’ve pushed aside my dreams in business and opened a hospital because I’ve come to the conclusion I wasn’t competent enough in marketing. Yet, I still want to try interesting business by meeting experts outside the medical field and constructing a synergic relationship with them. \n\nI believe that my closest five friends show who I am, and that is why I am searching for new friends that I can trust, and have experience in fields I am new to. In the morning of my weekdays, I spend my time swimming and doing Crossfit, and in the weekend I enjoy golfing. \n\nAnyone who enjoys swimming, Crossfit, or golfing, please feel free to contact me. \n\nThank you."
